The binary 'vanitysearch' needs to be compiled on Ubuntu 22.04 with CUDA 12.

This directory contains all the necessary files to compile the binary:
- Makefile: Configured for Ubuntu 22.04 with CUDA 12
- build.sh: Build script to automate the compilation process

To compile:
1. Copy this entire 'New-Ubuntu-Cuda12' directory to your Ubuntu 22.04 system with CUDA 12 installed
2. Make sure you also copy all the source files from the parent directory to the same level as this directory
3. Navigate to this directory in a terminal
4. Run the build script:
   chmod +x build.sh
   ./build.sh

The compilation will produce the 'vanitysearch' binary in this directory.

Note: The compilation requires:
- CUDA 12 toolkit installed
- g++ compiler
- NVIDIA GPU drivers compatible with CUDA 12

The resulting binary includes the following new features:
- Hash160 direct search mode (significantly faster than Base58/Bech32 addresses)
- Multi-GPU support with comma-separated GPU IDs
- End key range specification
- Optimized batch modular inverse for improved performance
